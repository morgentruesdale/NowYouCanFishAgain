# Now You Can Fish Again

A simple Pixelmon sidemod for versions 9.2.x that aims to make fishing possible until a fix has been implemented
for the missing lines/bobbers bug present in some of these versions.


## Features

Adds a sound effect that plays on a player when their line has a Pokemon on it. The sound is configurable in
the PokemonCatchEvent class and accepts any minecraft SoundEvents sound.

Also adds an optional message to display in chat for that player as well. Set the message to "false"
in the config to disable it entirely.

### Updating for new Pixelmon versions

1. Simply change the value of "pixelmon_version" in gradle.properties and build.
